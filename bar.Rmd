This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(canvasXpress)
vals = c(33,44,55)
vars = c("V1")
smps = c("S1","S2","S3")
data = as.data.frame(matrix(vals, nrow = 1, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE, dimnames = list(vars, smps)))
canvasXpress(
 data = data,
 graphOrientation = "vertical",
 graphType = "Bar",
 showLegend = FALSE,
 smpLabelRotate = 90,
 smpTitle = "Samples",
 theme = "CanvasXpress",
 title = "Bar Graph Title",
 xAxisTitle = "Value"
)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
